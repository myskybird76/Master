Master project codes

Final_data.py is the final automatic code that I used in my thesis. It loads original data from the directed folder, then calculates and saves the results and images automatically. Just we need to change the directory of images and the number of simulations.

calculation.py is the code to convert csv data to LaTEX code, it is used for my master thesis appendix.
